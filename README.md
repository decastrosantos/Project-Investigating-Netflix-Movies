**Exploring Netflix Data: A Data Analyst's Perspective**

Netflix, which began as a DVD rental service in 1997, has since evolved into one of the world's leading entertainment platforms. With an extensive catalog of movies and series, it presents a great opportunity for data-driven insights.

As a Data Analyst, I set out to explore Netflix's vast dataset, focusing on films released in the 1990s. My objective was to uncover trends and patterns in this iconic movie decade, leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights.

Using the dataset `netflix_data.csv`, I examined key attributes such as genre distribution, movie duration, and release trends. This analysis provides valuable information for understanding content preferences and potential opportunities for nostalgic productions.

This project showcases how data analytics can drive insights in the entertainment industry. Feel free to explore and expand on the findings!
